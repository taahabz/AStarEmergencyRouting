Introduction
• The objective of this open-ended lab is to design an AI system that determines the most efficient routes for fire trucks responding to emergency calls in a city. 
The goal is to optimize response time while accounting for dynamic conditions like road blockages and changing traffic patterns.

Objectives
•	To design an AO system for determining the most efficient routes for fire trucks. 

Data
1.	City Grid Layout: A 10 × 10 grid representing a simplified city layout. Each cell represents a road segment and an intersection. The diagram for the layout is given in the data file uploaded on LMS. 
2.	Traffic Data: Each road segment has an average travel speed that varies by time of the day. Moreover, data about road closures is also available in the data file. 
3.	Emergency call locations: Emergency call locations and their times are also given in the data file.
4.	Fire station locations: 
      Fire Station	Coordinates
      Fire Station 1	(1,1)
      Fire Station 2	(10,10)

Task Requirements:
1.	Algorithm Development: Design an AI system to find the fastest route from a given fire station to an emergency site. 
2.	Adaptive Strategy: The AI agent should be able to adapt to real-time changes such as road blockages and updated speeds. 
3.	Performance Evaluation: Measure the effectiveness of the chosen approach using metrics like total response time and number of successful navigations.
